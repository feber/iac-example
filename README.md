This repository illustrates the use of Terraform for provisioning the infrastructure (on top of OpenStack) and Ansible for installing different programs on the VMs. 
Ansible inventory file is generated by Terraform, following a template.
Likewise, jump host configuration for SSH-ing private nodes is also generated by Terraform.
